## 2026-01-07: Haptic Feedback Implementation

Added HAPTIC message handler to NativeBridge (services/NativeBridge.ts).

Changes:
- Added 'HAPTIC' to WebToNativeMessageType union
- Imported expo-haptics module
- Implemented handleHaptic() method supporting styles: light, medium, heavy, success, warning, error
- Default fallback to light impact for unspecified styles

The web app can now trigger device vibration via postMessage with:
  { type: 'HAPTIC', payload: { style: 'light' | 'medium' | 'heavy' | 'success' | 'warning' | 'error' } }

No more "Unknown message type: HAPTIC" warnings in console.

## 2026-01-07: QR Scanner Implementation

Added native QR scanner using expo-camera for scanning wallet addresses.

Changes:
- Created QRScannerModal component (components/QRScannerModal.tsx)
  - Full-screen camera modal with QR scanning overlay
  - Permission handling for camera access
  - Orange corner markers matching QRL branding
  - Close button and instruction text
- Integrated scanner in WalletScreen (app/(tabs)/index.tsx)
  - Added qrScannerVisible state
  - Registered handleQRScanRequest callback with NativeBridge
  - Connected scan results to NativeBridge.sendQRResult()
- Installed expo-camera package

Flow:
1. Web app sends SCAN_QR message via postMessage
2. NativeBridge routes to qrScanCallback -> opens scanner modal
3. User scans QR code with camera
4. Scanner sends data via NativeBridge.sendQRResult()
5. Web app receives QR_RESULT event with scanned address

The scanner passes any scanned QR data to the web app; address validation is handled by the web layer.
